        <p>I've recently started learning software development, and I wanted to share my experience so far.</p>
        
        <p>After years of having the desire to create digital tools, I finally decided to dive in. Honestly, I have nothing but immense respect and awe for people who have the code "in their fingers"; who know and understand this stuff inside and out. But I'm not one of them.</p>
        
        <p>In January 2024, with the relatively recent release of ChatGPT, I decided the time had come, and the tools were available to start making things with code. It's been a TON of frustration, trying to get the AI to create what I have in mind, but through the journey I've started to understand that code is rarely perfect the first time, and there's nothing like finally working out the last bug and seeing the vision come to life! </p>
